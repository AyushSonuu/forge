# Architecture Review

## Review Summary

The Forge idea is strong, but the project must stay disciplined. The winning product is not a generic orchestrator, a Kubernetes clone, or a Firecracker wrapper. The winning product is a simple, open-source workspace runtime for AI agents that can grow into stronger isolation and distributed operation over time.

## What Is Strong

### Workspace-first positioning

The workspace abstraction is the most valuable part of the project. AI agents need stateful, resumable environments rather than only one-shot command execution.

### Runtime-agnostic direction

Supporting Docker locally and Firecracker in production is a strong adoption path. Kubernetes can later provide distributed capacity without becoming the user-facing abstraction.

### Open and embeddable model

An open-source, self-hostable runtime layer is meaningfully different from hosted sandbox APIs.

### Snapshot and artifact primitives

Snapshots and artifacts match real agent workflows: resume state, export outputs, compare runs, and preserve results.

### Shared resource pool

The project becomes more valuable if it lets many users and applications share CPU, memory, storage, caches, workers, databases, and network capacity while preserving workspace and tenant isolation.

### LangChain compatibility

V1 becomes much more useful if Forge can be used directly as a LangChain Deep Agents sandbox backend instead of requiring custom integration code.

## Main Risks

### Risk 1: Scope explosion

The original idea included runtimes, storage, package managers, image systems, plugins, events, policy, scheduling, and specifications. That scope is too broad for the first version.

Recommendation: build a narrow MVP and defer external plugin APIs until multiple real backends exist.

### Risk 2: Over-generic interfaces

A design where everything is a generic resource and operation may look future-proof, but it can become hard to use and hard to reason about.

Recommendation: keep concrete product concepts in the public API: workspace, environment, execution, snapshot, and artifact.

### Risk 3: Premature Kubernetes-style architecture

Controllers, reconciliation loops, CRDs, and capability registries may become useful later, but they are not required for the MVP.

Recommendation: start with a straightforward API service and internal interfaces. Add reconciliation only when distributed operation requires it.

### Risk 4: Security overclaiming

Docker-based MVP isolation is not enough for hostile multi-tenant execution.

Recommendation: clearly document runtime-specific security boundaries and position Firecracker as the stronger V2 isolation path.

### Risk 5: Package-manager abstraction

Making package managers a core feature can create huge maintenance burden.

Recommendation: treat package installation as normal command execution in MVP. Add optional helpers later.

### Risk 6: Ignoring latency

A technically correct scheduler that starts workspaces slowly will feel bad to agent developers and end users.

Recommendation: track latency as a first-class metric from the beginning, even if advanced warm pools and autoscaling are delivered later.

## Interface Review

### Keep

- `RuntimeDriver`
- `WorkspaceStore`
- `ArtifactStore`
- `EventBus`

These are understandable and map directly to product behavior.

### Defer

- External plugin SDK.
- Universal `ResourceProvider` abstraction.
- Universal `OperationExecutor` abstraction.
- Package manager interfaces.
- Universal image builder.

These may be useful later, but they should not define the MVP.

## Recommended Build Order

1. Local workspace store.
2. Docker runtime driver.
3. Command execution with streaming logs.
4. Snapshot and restore.
5. Artifact export.
6. LangChain `ForgeSandbox` adapter.
7. SDK and CLI polish.
8. Firecracker runtime driver.
9. S3-compatible workspace store.
10. Remote workers and scheduler.
11. Autoscaling and latency-aware placement.
12. Stable extension API.

## Final Verdict

Forge is worth building if the project stays focused. The MVP should prove that persistent AI workspaces are useful. Firecracker, Kubernetes, plugins, and standards should come after that proof, not before it.
