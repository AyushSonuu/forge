# MVP Implementation Notes (living)

Companion to [mvp-design.md](mvp-design.md) and [mvp-implementation-plan.md](mvp-implementation-plan.md). The plan file lists feature scopes; this file tracks design **amendments** and **branch progress** as the MVP is built.

The full approved branch plan (with per-branch exit criteria) lives at `~/.claude/plans/goofy-napping-music.md`.

## Design amendments

### A1 — Runtime is session-oriented, not container-oriented

**When:** during branch 02 prep, after architectural review.

**Change:** the pool and driver expose a `RuntimeSession` abstraction, not a raw container lease. The execution service asks the pool for a session by *workspace + image*; the driver decides how to satisfy that (docker `--workdir` today, Firecracker block-device attach tomorrow, K8s PVC in V3). Nothing outside `drivers/` sees container IDs or bind-mount paths.

**Shape:**

```python
async with pool.session(workspace_id="ws_123", image="python:3.14-slim") as sess:
    result_1 = await sess.exec(["python", "main.py"])
    result_2 = await sess.exec(["pytest", "-q"])
```

**Consequences that flow from this:**

- Every command runs with `cwd=/workspace` (singular) regardless of runtime.
- Docker driver installs a tiny `/usr/local/bin/forge-run` helper that does `cd "$FORGE_WORKSPACE_DIR" && exec "$@"`; `docker exec` invokes `forge-run <user-cmd>` with `FORGE_WORKSPACE_DIR=/workspaces/<ws-id>` injected. User code never sees the multi-workspace `/workspaces` tree in its own path.
- Sessions are burst-friendly: a Deep Agents turn holds one session across multiple tool calls, amortizing lease overhead.
- V2 Firecracker driver plugs in by satisfying the same `RuntimeSession` protocol — no changes to services / SDK / LangChain adapter.
- V3 K8s / remote-worker drivers do likewise (schedule pod-with-PVC, sync-then-acquire).

### A2 — Baseline Python is 3.14

**When:** branch 02 prep.

**Change:** `requires-python = ">=3.14"`; `.python-version` pinned; CI installs 3.14; ruff `target-version = "py314"`; mypy `python_version = "3.14"`. Reason: operator directive.
